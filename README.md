## Adrian Booth

An enthusiastic, flame haired, tech fanatic seeking my first job in the industry. I have spent the past 3 months at Makers Academy learning not only how to code, but how to think. I've learnt how the agile 
process works, and why testing is essential when producing quality code. I am ideally looking to work in an environment that is collaborative, test driven, and provides support for junior staff in order to accelerate learning. I am language agnostic and know I can learn anything very quickly to start contributing value. 

You can get to know me better through my writing on my personal blog: http://ontheroadtocode.blogspot.co.uk/

Work Experience

World Experience
---------------
**8 Month Tour Across Africa** July 2013 - March 2014 
I booked a one way ticket to Cape Town after my graduation and hoped for the best. My plan was made up as I went along, but after some time decided to travel to Cairo from Cape Town
without flying. This trip took 8 months, and saw me climb Kilimanjaro, meet some Ugandan mountain gorillas, work for a Zambian children's charity, and land in hospital after getting 
ambushed and beaten in Sudan by a group of men. I travelled to 12 countries in total and wrote about it all on this blog:

**2 Month Tour Across India** May 2015 - July 2015
I flew to Mumbai and decided to immerse myself in Indian life. I immersed myself a bit too much, which led to 4 hospital visits in just 2 months, often due to food poisoning or a bad reaction
to the heat. Despite having to fly home a month early due to another bout of illness, I loved travelling across the subcontinent. South India was my favourite region and the scenery and cuisine 
had everything to do with that.


**3 Month Tour Around the World** June 2009 - September 2009 
I took my first backpacking trip around the world as I just turned 19. This led to experiences camping in Namibia, bungee jumping in New Zealand, shark diving in South Africa,
trekking in China, and many many more.
